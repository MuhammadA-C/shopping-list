Shopping List Project inspired from (Udemy) Modern JavaScript From The Beginning 2.0 - 2023 Road Map by Traversy Media

---

### Overview
This project was inspired by the shopping list project in (Udemy) Modern JavaScript From The Beginning 2.0 - 2023 Road Map by Traversy Media. 
However, I didn't follow the shopping list features as in the course. 

I decided to not include:
* Filter items/word search bar
* Edit items already added functionality
* Prevent duplicate entries
* Local storage to persist changes

---
### Why did I not include the functionality listed above?

I had a few reasons as to why I didn't include the functionality listed above:
1. I already worked on a somewhat similar project for school [WGU-C482-Project](https://github.com/MuhammadA-C/WGU-C482-Project)
2. I am currently working on another school project that expands more on WGU-C482-Project, and that adds a database for persistent storage
3. I am working on The Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript course, and it has a Todo List App Project that includes similar functionality as this Shopping List Project

Overall, I decided not to go through with incorporating everything because in the other projects that I am working on they include similar features. 
So, I will leave it to those projects which expand upon these features to include them and show them off.
